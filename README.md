Kris Jones - Blockchain Researcher (Social), Communications, and Government

Hey Genesis DAO folks, I am hoping to onboard myself to experiment with currently existing DAO infrastructure in order to 
better understand where we are in our development and movement toward fully functioning and interacting DAOs. I hope to
gain enough insight through interaction here to be able to write more intelligently about DAOs and their current capabilities,
as well as the possibilities for integrating into a number of existing processes and systems, or the opportunities to create
better, more inclusive and responsive processes and systems for the future.

I wrote my Master's thesis on Blockchain and its social and political implications. If you are interested in that piece of work,
it is puclished on the Queen's University research portal here: qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/24924.

I was exposed to DAOstack through the Decentralized Thriving ebook, which has some really great and inspirational pieces. I have 
also been interested and involved in working toward better tooling for digital governance, and have been involved in the 
RadicalxChange movement. I have also been involved most intensely in the blockchain space with the Ethereum ecosystem, having 
most recently attended ETHDenver, while also operating some small scall GPU miners.
